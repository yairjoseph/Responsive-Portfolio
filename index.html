                    <p> I'm Yair Joseph, originally from Jerusalem, Israel and Currently living in Sherman Oaks. I've served
                        in the military for 3 years in Israel, which gave me many tools that have taught me a lot about my
                        self, about self-discipline, and team work.
                    </p>
                    <p>Putting in the hard work always paid off and got me to where I wanted to reach. I've been a contractor
                        for a few years, but have always had a passion for tech.
                    </p>
                    <p> I decided to get into the tech world and take on studying how to be a full stack developer at UCLA
                        Extention. The learning setting is very intense and lets us stay on top of everything constantly.
                        I'm always looking to learn and create new things, and it's why I'm so excited about this new voyage!
